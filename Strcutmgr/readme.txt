NOT FINISHED YET
Welcome to Strcutmgr
This is a program that enables the user to use a keyboard shortcut to call a gui window that will have a list of functions.
The gui window can be navigated using the keyboard and there will be alot of different functions to call
*it might contain a list of commands or notes that anyone can just check if needed
The program will run in the background and will wait for a certian keyboard shortcut.
